/*
 * This is a temporary define. Ultimately this define will be replaced with a
 * configuration a field to determine whether the extension is in mesh mode or
 * not. Actual application of mesh settings will be implemented in the function
 * configuration_apply().
 *
 * To enable, set it to 1, any other value to diable.
 *
 * Note that if mesh experimental code is enabled it will require some libraries
 * in the SDK to be updated otherwise compilation will fail. To achieve this
 * uncomment the rule "all" in the Makefile.
 *
 * By default mesh mode is disabled.
